Our SDKs are open source, but the code that powers our website and infrastructure is primarily not.\n\n\n\n\nWhy should I not just do my own key storage for new users?\n\n\nSecure key storage is very challenging, and a siloed approach will be inconvenient for your users. Users will have to fund this wallet separately, and can only manage their assets through your interface.\n\n\n\n\nCan I use my Bitski account with Dapps that do not use the Bitski SDK?\n\n\nCurrently no. This is something we are planning to address with a browser extension soon.\n\n\n\n\nHow much can I brand the Bitski transaction flow\n\n\nCurrently there is no customization of the transaction flow.\n\n\n\n\nI already have an app that uses Metamask, can I use Bitski?\n\n\nYes, they can. It doesn't negate any other wallet. It improves the dapp experience.\n\n\n\n\nHow do I submit my dApp for Bitski?\n\n\nYou can request access from our Developer Portal.\n\n\n\n\nHow are you storing private keys?\n\n\nOur keys are both created and stored on our HSMs (Hardware Security Module). Approved transactions are passed to the HSM to sign. The keys never leave the hardware.\n\n\n\n\nDo you have an Android SDK?\n\n\nNot at the moment, but that is on our roadmap.\n\n\n\n\nHow should I integrate Bitski in my dapp?\n\n\nA good place to start is to put our sign in button wherever you're currently asking people to install Metamask.\n\n\n\n\nHow much lock in is there when building with Bitski?\n\n\nBitski has about as much lock in as other wallet providers. Since your users will presumably store assets from your app in our wallet, they will need Bitski to continue to use those assets. However, if the asset is transferrable, the user could decide to move them to another wallet instead.\n\n\n\n\nCan Bitski use ENS or Namecoin or other public naming systems?\n\n\nCurrently our wallet does not support sending to ENS names, or other public naming systems.\n\n\n\n\nCan I use Infura with Bitski?\n\n\nBitski provides the same services that Infura provides, so that would not be necessary.\n\n\n\n\nHow will users fund their wallet?\n\n\nFor ETH, currently they will need to use another service to purchase ETH with fiat currency, and transfer that to their Bitski wallet. Eventually we'll have a more integrated process.\n\n\nHowever, if you're working with digital assets, we suggest using our app wallet API to send assets to users directly. This prevents the need for the user to purchase ETH, while allowing them to have decentralized ownership.",

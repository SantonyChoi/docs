This makes it much easier to manage funding, deploying, and migrating your dapp's contracts.\n\n\nOn top of that, you can use your app wallet to securely perform any transactions you want from your backend using OAuth Client Credentials.\n\n\nGetting your credentials\n\n\nWhile we are in private beta this is a manual process. You can request an app wallet here. Once we create one for you, you can visit the \nDeveloper Portal\n to see your credentials. Make sure to keep these keys a secret, because we will sign any transaction that is submitted using them.\n\n\nFunding your dev wallet\n\n\nThis is currently a manual process as well. We recommend buying ETH from a third-party such as \nCoinbase\n and sending it to your app wallet's address. You can find your address in the \nDeveloper Portal\n.\n\n\nDeploying Contracts with Truffle\n\n\nWe have a simple Truffle plugin that makes deploying contracts with your App Wallet easy. Read more about it \nhere\n.\n\n\nSubmitting transactions\n\n\nYou can also use standard Web3 apis on your backend to perform anything you want using your wallet. Here's how it works:\n\n\nFirst, you'll use your client id and secret to request an access token using OAuth Client Credentials. Most platforms have a library that can handle this step for you. Your token has a relatively short lifespan, so you'll probably want to perform this step before every request. You must request the scope \neth_sign\n.\n\n\nPOST /oauth2/token HTTP/2\nHost: https://account.bitski.com\n\ngrant_type=client_credentials\n\nclient_id=YOUR CLIENT ID\n\nclient_secret=YOUR CLIENT SECRET\n\nscope=eth_sign\n\n\n\n\nHTTP/2 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\nCache-Control: no-store\nPragma: no-cache\n\n{\n  \naccess_token\n: \nYOUR ACCESS TOKEN\n,\n  \ntoken_type\n: \nbearer\n,\n  \nexpires_in\n: 3600,\n  \nscope\n: \neth_sign\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have an access token, you must add that to the Authorization header for your API request.

However, we will have support for the main Ethereum network soon.\n\n\n\n\nHow much does Bitski charge?\n\n\nBitski is currently free of charge for users and developers.\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the benefits of Bitski managing key storage for new users?\n\n\nSecure key storage is very challenging, and a siloed approach will be inconvenient for your users. Users will have to fund this wallet separately, and can only manage their assets through your interface.\n\n\n\n\nHow should I integrate Bitski in my dapp?\n\n\nA great place to start is to put our sign in button wherever you're currently asking people to install Metamask.\n\n\n\n\nI already have an app that uses Metamask, can I use Bitski?\n\n\nThe Bitski SDK is designed to be compatible with other wallets and dapp browsers, while providing a great experience for users who don't already have a wallet. Learn more about integrating our JS SDK \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nHow are you storing and managing private keys?\n\n\nOur keys are both created and stored on our HSMs (Hardware Security Module). Approved transactions are passed to the HSM to sign. The keys never leave the hardware.\n\n\n\n\nDo you have an Android SDK?\n\n\nNot at the moment, but that is on our roadmap.\n\n\n\n\nHow will users fund their wallet?\n\n\nCurrently for ETH, users will need to use another service to purchase ETH with fiat currency, and transfer that to their Bitski wallet. We will eventually have a more integrated process.\n\n\nHowever, if you're working with digital assets, we suggest using our app wallet API to send assets to users directly. This prevents the need for the user to purchase ETH, while allowing them to have decentralized ownership.",
